---

I have been selected as the Outreachy Intern.I am really excited to be the part of this community.Primarily I was involved in solving issues in the Lagom's Online Auction Java project.

But now I will be involved in adding the functionalities to User and Transaction Service.
I honestly can't wait for this summer to begin this internship.
I will be blogging about my progress so Stay Tuned!
