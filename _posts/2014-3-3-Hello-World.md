Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](C) on GitHub.
I have been selected as the Outreachy Intern.I am really excited to be the part of this community.Primarily I was involved in solving issues in the Lagom's Online Auction Java project.
But now I will be involved in adding the functionalities to User and Transaction Service.
I honestly can't wait for this summer to begin this internship.
